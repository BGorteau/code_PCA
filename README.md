# code_PCA

In this project we have to program a PCA through four questions that we are asked.
The data used in this project are `alcool.csv`.

## The four questions that were asked are

- Program a `cr` function that centers and reduces an array of data.

- Program an `acp` function to perform the following PCA calculations (the reduced centered table will be given as input)
  * calculation of axis-by-axis inertia (in percent) ;
  * variable coordinates on axes (for 3 axes) ;
  * coordinates of individuals on axes (for 3 axes); 
  Compare with `FactoMineR`'s `PCA` function.
  
- Program a `plotacp` function to produce PCA graphs (input will be the list containing PCA calculations and the chosen axes, and the graph type, "variables" or "individuals").

- Program an `indsup` function to calculate the coordinates of additional individuals (for 3 axes).
